  * provides tool for assesing project-specific perceived language complexety in issues
  * studies the language of issue discussions
  * analyzes the influence of said language on issue resolution time
  * project-specific and github wide assessment

  * assesses which parts of a program have been relevant for bugs
  * uses a selection of 28 metrics \(24 of which were discriminative\)
    * all three types of metrics together predicted 80% of all known vulnerable files w/ less than 25% false positives
